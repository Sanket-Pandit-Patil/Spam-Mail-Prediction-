# Spam-Mail-Prediction-
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham). It leverages a Logistic Regression model and the TF-IDF Vectorizer to extract meaningful features from text data for effective classification.

##Overview :
Spam emails are a significant nuisance and a potential security risk. This project builds a predictive model to identify spam emails with high accuracy, using a dataset of labeled emails.
---
##Features :
1.Preprocessing of raw email data to clean and standardize text.
2.Extraction of meaningful features using TF-IDF Vectorization.
3.Training and testing of a Logistic Regression model for classification.
4.Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

##Installation :
Setup on Google Colab
1.Open Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com.
2.Upload the Jupyter notebook file (spam_mail_prediction.ipynb) to your Colab environment.
3.Ensure the required libraries are available in the Colab runtime. Colab typically includes most required libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy pre-installed.
4.If needed, install additional dependencies in the Colab notebook using the following command:
  Copy code
  !pip install <library_name>  
---
##Usage :
Upload your dataset (e.g., a CSV file) to the Colab notebook. You can do this by clicking the Files tab in the Colab sidebar and using the upload option.
Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the performance.
View the output metrics and plots to understand the model's effectiveness.

##Project Workflow :
1.Data Preprocessing
   Cleaning and tokenizing the email text.
   Removing stop words and punctuation.
2.Feature Extraction
   Applying TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text into numerical features.
3.Model Training and Testing
   Training a Logistic Regression model on the transformed data.
   Testing the model with unseen data.
4.Evaluation
   Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance.
